we need to design the parser but we need to set some assumptions before.
1. each always block will have a single output
2. the "end" operator will be only for always block
3. in always block, only the always statement will have begin and end (neither if nor case will have any begin or end)
    always @() begin

    end
4. in conditional continuous assignment, the two cases will be only single variable. // assign out = x? a : b;
5. in case statement: the case and operation will be on the same line 
    case (param)
        1'd0 : (expr);
        1'd1 : (expr);


some assumptions:
1. operation
